## 1. Ist-Situation
- There are many social media platforms, that offer a wide range of possibilities to post and share content.
However none of them are really laid out for the consumer, rather the producer. 
The problem is always the same, a new App arrives, it becomes popular, the app becomes popular with companies and then it gets flooded with ads, ai slop and creator content that is (mostly) not interesting to the consumer.
No platform really allows to mix and match content, its always either in a text form or in a picture form, but never both.
And this can hurt artists that have to compete with billion-dollar companies and ai creators.

## 2. Improvement
- The Idea is to create a platform, that allows to post artwork, text, pictures, etc.. in a centralized forum, rather that
spread across different platforms. Allowing for discussions, feedback and a more personal touch to the content.

## 3. Goals

- Give creative people a platform to post about interests, works, etc.

- Create different "Boards" for different topics, that users can join / create

- Moderation, so that the platform stays clean and friendly

- User profiles, so that user can see information and joined boards
